/////////////
So basically, in whatever script you want to use it.
20:01 - Professor Slack: at the top.
20:01 - Professor Slack: import GUISizerns;
20:01 - Professor Slack: And then
20:02 - Professor Slack: GUISizer.BeginGUI(native x,native y);
//gui code
GUISizer.EndGUI();
20:02 - Professor Slack: In ongui.
20:03 - Sirius ?: WIDTH AND HEIGHT being what
20:04 - Professor Slack: No.
20:04 - Professor Slack: You put that in GUISizer.cs
20:04 - Professor Slack: And then you import the namespace.
20:04 - Professor Slack: And use it from wherever you want like i showed you.
20:04 - Professor Slack: WIDTH and HEIGHT are the width and the height at which the GUI is ideal for.

20:11 - Professor Slack: Also.
20:11 - Professor Slack: Don't use Screen.width and Screen.height.
20:11 - Professor Slack: Replace those with the x and y you put in the thing.
