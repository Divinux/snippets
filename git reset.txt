https://dev.to/dogealgo/how-to-delete-remote-commits-in-git-11h0
Assume you have pushed commits in order A1 => B2 => C3 in remote repository.

Now you want to delete commits C3 and B2.

The simple solution is as follows using git reset
 git reset --hard <A1-commit-id>
 git push -f origin <branch-name>
However, you should avoid doing this if anyone else is working with your remote repository and has pulled your changes C3 and B2.

That's where git revert comes in
git revert --no-commit C3
git revert --no-commit B2
git commit -m "commit message for your reverts"
