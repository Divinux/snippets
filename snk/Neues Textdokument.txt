23:51 - Viewtiful Joel: Add this to a gameobject, change luaPath to the name of a lua file in your Application.dataPath.
23:52 - Viewtiful Joel: Everything gets taken care of. functions Start, Update, FixedUpdate and OnGUI now work with that script.
23:52 - Viewtiful Joel: Here's a small lua script i made to test that
23:52 - Viewtiful Joel: http://pastebin.com/AvD8eB1Q
23:53 - Viewtiful Joel: It opens a console that you can write lua into and it does stuff.

low weight/high reps sets that is for bulk aka Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy sounds like you want Myofibrillated hypertrophy your muscle won't get as big but they will be lean and hard from heavy weight/low rep 85-90% of your one rep max.? Elliot did a video on it called "training for Boxers"



17:29 - Professor Slack: class Need{
var needName:String;
var needPointer:float=100;
var needMax:float=100;
var needTriggerThreshold:float=50;
var needDecreaseRate:float=0.5;
var needType:int;
}
var needs:Need[];



17:29 - Professor Slack: Oh, right.
17:29 - Professor Slack: Right under  var needTriggerThreshold:float=50;
17:30 - Professor Slack: var needDecreaseRate:float=0.5;
17:30 - NB: who's Var?
17:30 - Professor Seirius ?: cute short name for variable
17:30 - Professor Slack: function Update(){
for(var shoe in needs){
shoe.needPointer-=Time.deltaTime*needDecreaseRate;
}
}
17:31 - Professor Seirius ?: sure, still nothing new here
17:31 - Professor Slack: That's pretty simple. You just make a bunch of timers that go down over time.
17:31 - Professor Slack: The important part is needType.
17:31 - Professor Seirius ?: ok thats what i have sans the classes
17:31 - Professor Slack: WaypointScript.js
17:31 - Professor Seirius ?: go on
17:31 - Professor Slack: var waypointType:int=-1;
17:32 - Professor Slack: -1 means it's a simple waypoint that satisfies no needs.
17:32 - Professor Slack: Now, on the AI.
17:32 - Professor Slack: Right below shoe.needPointer-=Time.deltaTime*needDecreaseRate;
17:33 - Professor Slack: if(shoe.needPointer<shoe.needTriggerThreshold)
//find closest waypoint whose type is shoe.needType.
17:33 - Professor Slack: //go to that waypoint to satisfy need.
17:33 - Professor Slack: You'll also need a basic need ranking thingy to not have needs overlap.
17:34 - Professor Slack: So in the Need class, var needRank:int=0;
17:34 - Professor Slack: and
17:34 - Professor Slack: if(shoe.needPointer<shoe.needTriggerThreshold)
17:34 - Professor Slack: becomes
17:34 - Professor Slack: if(shoe.needPointer<shoe.needTriggerThreshold&&currentNeedRank<shoe.needRank)
17:34 - Professor Slack: And right below that
17:35 - Professor Slack: currentNeedRank=needRank;
17:35 - Professor Slack: You'll of course have to make a new currentNeedRank variable, outside that class.
17:35 - Professor Slack: Once the need has been satisfied, set currentNeedRank to 0.
17:35 - Professor Slack: And there you have it, a completely modular needs system.
17:35 - Professor Seirius ?: yep still followi-
17:36 - Professor Seirius ?: hang on must compile in my head :V
17:36 - Professor Slack: You can freely add and remove needs without having to hardcode them.
17:36 - Professor Seirius ?: yeah that part was completely unnecessary :V
17:36 - Professor Slack: Not really. It's way more helpful than you think.
17:37 - Professor Seirius ?: you became such a fan of classes and libraries recently :V
17:37 - Professor Seirius ?: i mean thats a good thing
17:37 - Professor Slack: I am obsessed with making everything as modular as possible.
17:37 - Professor Slack: Adding new things to it with little to no changes in code at all.
17:37 - Professor Seirius ?: and yet your code inset and variable declaration is confus as fuk
17:37 - Professor Seirius ?: of you that get better too :F
17:38 - Professor Slack: That last sentence made no sense.
17:38 - NB: Snake's NerdRank=10;
17:38 - Professor Seirius ?: :I
17:38 - Professor Seirius ?: my brain produces too much overhead.
17:38 - Professor Seirius ?: still compiling.
17:39 - NB: Sirius' NerdRank=10;
17:39 - NB: :>
17:39 - Professor Slack: NB's uselessness rank is 100.
17:39 - Professor Seirius ?: ok im reall yjust interested in this 17:34 - Professor Slack: if(shoe.needPointer<shoe.needTriggerThreshold&&currentNeedRank<shoe.needRank)
17:39 - Professor Seirius ?: haha /me points at nb
17:39 - NB: i'm not useless
17:39 - Professor Seirius ?: so youre saying... an action is triggered when
17:40 - Professor Slack: Remind me again, what exactly are you doing with your life?
17:40 - Professor Slack: Oh right, being silly.
17:40 - Professor Seirius ?: a need drops below its threshold.
17:40 - Professor Seirius ?: and also
17:40 - Professor Slack: A need drops below it's threshold, as long as the need is more important than the current need the AI is tending to.
17:40 - NB: i'm not silly
17:40 - Professor Seirius ?: ooh yes.
17:41 - Professor Seirius ?: yeah thats glorious.
17:41 - Professor Slack: Or, more important than nothing, if the AI isn't tending to anything.
17:41 - The Anti-Quarian hat die Verbindung getrennt.
17:41 - Professor Seirius ?: i was just having one active action and just reviewing what action to take next once it finishes.
17:41 - Professor Seirius ?: which is a bad thing to do.
17:41 - The Anti-Quarian hat den Gruppenchat betreten.
17:41 - Professor Seirius ?: /me copypastes this chet
